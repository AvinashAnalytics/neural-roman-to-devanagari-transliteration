# Includes core training, evaluation, and Streamlit GUI
# =================================================================

# --- Core Deep Learning ---
# Pin PyTorch version for reproducibility.
# Ensure you install the correct version for your CUDA setup.
# Example for CUDA 12.1: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
torch>=2.1.0

# --- Data Handling & Processing ---
numpy>=1.23.0                # Fundamental package for numerical operations
pandas>=1.5.0                # Used in the GUI for displaying data tables
tqdm>=4.64.0                 # For beautiful progress bars in scripts
requests>=2.28.0             # For downloading data and making API calls

# --- Configuration & Serialization ---
PyYAML>=6.0                  # For loading the config.yaml file
scikit-learn                 # Though not used directly, often a core dependency of other ML libs. Good to have.

# --- LLM Provider Libraries (all optional but recommended) ---
# Each of these is wrapped in a try-except block, so they are not strictly required.
# However, to use a provider, its library must be installed.
openai>=1.3.0                # For OpenAI and compatible APIs (like Groq, DeepInfra)
anthropic>=0.20.0            # For Claude models
google-generativeai>=0.4.0   # For Google Gemini models
groq>=0.5.0                  # Official Groq client library

# --- GUI Framework ---
streamlit>=1.30.0            # The core web application framework
plotly>=5.15.0               # For creating interactive charts in the GUI

# --- Optional but Recommended ---
wandb>=0.15.0                # For experiment tracking (optional, guarded by a flag)
